## Hello

My name is Matthew Martin, and I am a software engineer in the Milwaukee Area. 

I am building this website as a promotional outlet for both my professional experiences and my growing game development portfolio.

My resume can be located on the corresponding page. Keep watching this site for development progress updates, tutorials, and post mortems on game jam entries.

You can find me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-martin-37a663162/)
